# SillySQL

A relational database is the most common means of data storage and retrieval in the modern age. A relational database model stores data into one or more tables, where each table has columns and rows. The columns represent a value that can be attributed to an entry (such as color, name, or ID) and the rows represent individual entries or records (such as Paoletti, my_cat, or BBB_1695). You may find it helpful to think about rows as objects and columns as descriptors for those objects. For instance, the table pictured below has each row corresponding to a car (a data type), and the columns group a car’s vendors, model, etc. such that this information can be easily retrieved. Rows in relational databases are also called records or tuples, but in this project we will use the terminology “row” for consistency. Rows in Project 3 are not guaranteed to be unique.

# Learning Goals
Selecting appropriate data structures for a given problem. Now that you know how to use various abstract data types, it’s important that you are able to evaluate which will be the optimal for a set of tasks.
Evaluating the runtime and storage tradeoffs for storing and accessing data contained in multiple data structures.
Designing a range of algorithms to handle different situations.
Evaluating different representations of the same data.
